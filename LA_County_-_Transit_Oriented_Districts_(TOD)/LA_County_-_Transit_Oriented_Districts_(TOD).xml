            <abstract>This layer represents the Transit Oriented Districts depicted in Figure 6.5 in the General Plan 2035. These are urban and suburban areas with access to major transit and commercial corridors that have the most potential for infill development, and are well-suited for higher density housing and mixed uses. With the exception of the East Los Angeles 3rd Street Specific Plan, and Willowbrook TOD Specific Plan, all of these are 1/2 mile buffers around a major transit stop.
