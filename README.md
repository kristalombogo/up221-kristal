This is Kristal Ombogo’s repository for UP221- Introduction to GIS and Spatial Data Science

## Introduction 

I am a fourth year Undergraduate majoring in Public Affairs and Education & Social Transformation. I am currently completing my capstone project in corporate landlords and land use in South Central LA. I hope to use GIS and spatial analysis as a way to make that data more accessible, and foster more of my interest in transportation planning. 

## Course Objectives
Most of my coding experience is with R, and I’ve had to teach myself ArcGIS through internships, so I’m very excited to learn more from this class. Learning Python is a skillset that will be particularly beneficial in my professional career.  I am especially eager to learn how to use GIS for practice, advocacy, and policy work, as highlighted in the course description. This course is a first step as I start to think about my plans and interest in data analysis and urban planning post grad.
